    "The study of grammar has an ancient pedigree: Panini's grammar of Sanskrit was written over two thousand years ago and is still referenced today in teaching Sanskrit. Is is arguably the most successful generative grammar as of yet. By contrast, Geoff Pullum (a famous syntactician) noted that \"almost everything most educated Americans believe about English grammar is wrong\". Here we will take a stab at addressing the grammar from the generative, as well as computational, point of view."

    "The fundamental idea of constituency is that groups of words may behave as a single unit or phrase, called a **constituent**. Consider the noun phrase, a sequence of words surrounding at least one noun or pronoun, e.g., *she, Mary, the house, Russian Hill, a well-weathered three-story structure, a high-class spot such as Mindy's, the reason he comes to this place*. How do we know that these words form a constituent?"

    "The most commonly used mathematical system for modeling constituent structure in English and other natural languages is the **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**. The idea of basing a grammar on constituent structure dates back to the psychologist Wilhelm Wundt (1900), but was not formalized until Chomsky (1956) and, independently, Backus (1959). A context-free grammar consists of a set of **rules** or **productions**, each of which expresses the ways that symbols of the language can be grouped and ordered together, and a **lexicon** of words and symbols. \n",

    "\n",
    "A context-free grammar (CFG) is a set of recursive rewriting rules (or productions) used to generate patterns of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CFG consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ a set of terminal symbols, which are the characters of the alphabet that appear in the strings generated by the grammar;\n",
    "+ a set of nonterminal symbols, which are placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols that can be generated by the nonterminal symbols;\n",
    "+ a set of productions, which are rules for replacing (or rewriting) nonterminal symbols (on the left side of the production) in a string with other nonterminal or terminal symbols (on the right side of the production);\n",
    "+ a start symbol, which is a special nonterminal symbol that appears in the initial string generated by the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a string of terminal symbols from a CFG, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ begin with a string consisting of the start symbol;\n",
    "+ apply one of the productions with the start symbol on the left hand size, replacing the start symbol with the right hand side of the production;\n",
