## Final Project Guidelines

### Requirements

1. Code (16 points):

A piece of code that addresses some linguistic problem. Your code should be roughly equivalent to two homework assignments.
It should be working without any modifications and it should contain at least 3 independently defined functions. 

Ideally, it should address a problem that reflects your interests and is relevant for your research.

2. Write-up (11 points):

The write-up could be done as a text part of the .ipynb file (the text can be interspersed with code) or as a text document separate from the file with your code.
It should not be very long, but it should: a) state the goal of your project (1p.); b) state why your project is interesting (2p.);
c) reformulate the problem in terms of functions that you plan to code (2p.); d) describe what your program does and how it does it (2p.);
e) state what your code accomplishes (2p.); f) state the program limitations and possible future improvements (2p.).

Minus 2 points, if the write-up is poorly structured and unclear.

### Timeline

19.10 -- e-mail me a preliminary idea or talk to me after class. You don't have to fully commit to this preliminary idea.

whenever our next class is (possibly, 2.11) -- consultation

09.11 -- the code and the write-up are due -- **no late work is accepted**
