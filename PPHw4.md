# Assignment 4 -- due 19.10 by 9.00

1. Internet data -- up to 5 points

Choose a web page, download its contents into a file. Clean the data so that only the text parts remain (you can use lxml, bs4 and/or regular expressions).

+ 1 point -- the contents of a web page are downloaded into a file;
+ 2 points -- the contents are cleaned until only the text remains (links, HTML code are deleted);
+ 1 point -- a file with the text is submitted alongside the code;
+ 1 point -- the code is running without problems, is written in Jupiter notebook.

2. Plots -- you should choose **one** of the options -- up to 5 points

2.1 Choose any type of plot that we haven't discussed in class (see the handout), create a toy dataset and create a plot.

Here you can find a lot of different types of plots: https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html

+ 1 point -- a toy data set is created;
+ 1 point -- plot type selection justification (say a few words about why you have chosen that particular plot type);
+ 1 point -- a plot;
+ 1 point -- additional parameters of the plot (colour of the dots, width of the lines, lagend, lables for the dots etc.);
+ 1 point -- the plot is saved (include the relevant piece of code) and submitted as a separate file.

2.2 Choose a dataset (from a paper, handout, your own research) and plot it using `matplotlib` or any other library.

+ 1 point -- a data set is selected (it could be part of the original data set);
+ 1 point -- data set selection justification (say a few words about where the data came from and about why you have chosen it);
+ 1 point -- a plot;
+ 1 point -- additional parameters of the plot (colour of the dots, width of the lines, lagend, lables for the dots etc.);
+ 1 point -- the plot is saved (include the relevant piece of code) and submitted as a separate file.

3. Final Project Idea -- 1 point

Say a few words about what you might want to do as your final project -- you don't have to commit to this idea or ideas.
